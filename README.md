# rmsft.mptWrapper
libopenmpt C# wrapper because i want one.

This is a major work in progress.

# What's the goal?
I want to make a game that uses tracker music because Games like *Zelda: Twilight princess* have a dynamic midi-like music system.  Multiple tracks using a self-contained bank of instruments. How cool is that?


# OK, how does this help with that goal?
This library will (hopefully) be used with existing WIP of a game that has yet to see the light of day.
If the game thing doesn't work out, its still a publically available C# wrapper for libopenmpt, which i haven't seen elsewhere yet, so why not.

# libopenmpt? 

A library made at https://openmpt.org/
OpenMPT is what I use to make music.
