# rmsft.mptWrapper
A work in progress!

## What's the goal?
I want to make a game that uses tracker music because I am intrigued by Games like *Zelda: Twilight princess* have a dynamic music system.  Multiple tracks using a self-contained bank of instruments, with ease of controling channels based on the situation? No painstaking looping of wav files? not using dozens of 100 mb high quality 30-120 second audio files? Sign me up!



## OK, how does this help with that goal?
This library will (hopefully) be used with existing WIP of a game that has yet to see the light of day.
If the game thing doesn't work out, its still a publically available C# wrapper for libopenmpt, which i haven't seen elsewhere yet, so why not.

## libopenmpt? 

A library made at https://openmpt.org/
OpenMPT is what I use to make music.
